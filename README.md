test for Python Rest server

## Environments variables to set

You can generate your API key at `<your_discourse_url>/admin/users/8/<username>`

* DISCOURSE_BASE_URL : Base URL of your instance of Discourse
* DISCOURSE_API_KEY : API key generated by Discourse
* DISCOUSE_USERNAME : The username you've registered your API key under

## Configuration files :
    
* _runtime.txt_ and Procfile : Both files are used by Heroku
* _.travis.yml_ is used by Travis CI
* _.coverage_ is the reports sent to Coveralls for coverage analysis

## __problems for now__ : 
can't make pytest pass in CLI because of a import error. pytest command is : `py.test test/ --doctest-modules -v --cov application --cov-report term-missing`

* ~~Httmock is in the requirements and has been imported by PyCharm.~~ Corrected. Solution was to pip install the requirements.
* ~~New problem is that the tested code isn't found by pytest.~~ Corrected. Bad imports and I forgot to use virtualenv
